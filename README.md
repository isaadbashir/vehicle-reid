2. add a folder `supervised` if not present.
3. add you project e.g. `ABC-XYZ` in the `supervised` folder.
4. create a new **branch** with naming scheme as `addproject/NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT` e.g. `addproject/Tripletwise-Improved-CNN`.
5. add a README.md file and add all the instructions to run the project.
6. create the Pull Request for merger into the master fro your branch and keep your concerned supervisor and co-supervisor reviewers.
7. voila!! you are done.

## Contributing to a Project

If you are assigned to contribute to a project then here is the process of doing this

1. clone the repo.
2. create a branch with naming scheme as `feature/supervised|unsupervised/PROJECT/YOUR-IMPROVEMENT-OR-FEATURE` e.g. `feature/unsupervised/VR-PROUD/inception-v4-added-to-models` 
the branch name should be self explanatroy.
3. work on branch and commit often and once done push the changes and create a Pull Request for merge and keep you supervisor
and co-supervisior as reviewers.
